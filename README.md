## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed for customers feeling personally on the scences. It is attractive and impressive. Plenty of the images on the page showed exactly what products have in store.

### Colour
For the colour design warm grey tones that is  luxurious and elegant were chosen to match the images on the page and also the colour theme of the actual bakery store. To narrow down the colours I used Adobe Color which assists me with better vision feeling.
