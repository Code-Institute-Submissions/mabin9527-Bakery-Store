## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed for customers feeling personally on the scences. It is attractive and impressive. Plenty of the images on the page showed exactly what products have in store.

### Colour
For the colour design warm grey tones that is luxurious and elegant were chosen to match the images on the page and also the colour theme of the actual bakery store. To narrow down the colours I used Adobe Color which assists me with better vision feeling.

### Fonts
For consistency the webpage was designed by importing Lato and sans-serif font style which follows love-running project.
<br>
Lato and sans-serif look like simple, clean and friendly to website user.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well-known, recognizable, user friendly, and easy-to-learn way. Users will see a familiar type of navigation bar with bakery store logo on the left side and the navigation links on the other side when customers first come to our website.
